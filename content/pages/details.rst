Schedule
========
The event will start Thursday afternoon with introductions and a get-together.
All day Friday and Saturday are dedicated to hacking on projects, with
tutorials and break-out/unconference sessions happening as needed.
Early-evening on Saturday, there will be a wrap-up session with a short
presentation from each project on their achievements.

Due to the nature of the event, the schedule is flexible and can change
frequently. To stay up-to-date, you can subscribe to a `Google calendar
<https://tinyurl.com/ybx23trf>`_.

Alternatively, you can use the free and open source
`Giggity App <https://wilmer.gaa.st/main.php/giggity.html>`_ that is available
for Android devices. Just install it from
`F-Droid <https://f-droid.org/app/net.gaast.giggity>`_ or `Google Play
<https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.gaast.giggity>`_, and scan

Venue
=====
The event will take place on the `main university campus
<https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=18/52.13985/11.64565>`_ in Magdeburg. While
some details are still in flux, we will have multiple hack rooms with solid
wireless *and* wired network.

The weather will be great; there is a park right around the corner, and places
to relax and get some fresh air right outside the buildings.

Most importantly, there are at least two dedicated coffee bars nearby that will
help you find the exact type of caffeine source that *you* need to crank out all
that scientific output goodness.

Accomodation
============
Attendees will organize their accommodations individually. Magdeburg offers a
range of places to stay. Here are two affordable options:

- Hostel: http://www.jugendherberge-magdeburg.de
- B&B: https://www.hotelbb.de/de/magdeburg

If you are a sucker for an opulent breakfast, take a look at the `Maritim
<https://www.maritim.de/de/hotels/deutschland/hotel-magdeburg/unser-hotel>`_,
but you gotta pay the price.

Transportation
==============
While Magdeburg has an airport, most people will want to fly to
`LEJ <https://www.leipzig-halle-airport.de/>`_ or
`BER <http://www.berlin-airport.de>`_ and then take the train to Magdeburg,
which will take between 90min (LEJ) and 2 hours (BER).

Otherwise, Magdeburg is easy to get to from all directions by
`train <https://www.bahn.de>`_, or by
`car <https://www.google.de/maps/dir//Otto-von-Guericke-Universit%C3%A4t+Magdeburg,+Universit%C3%A4tsplatz,+Magdeburg/@52.1401845,11.6418375,17z/data=!4m8!4m7!1m0!1m5!1m1!1s0x47af5f4e8655c243:0x2aa651e3d67867a6!2m2!1d11.6441991!2d52.1402053>`_
(A2 and A14).

The main venue and all accommodation options mentioned above are in walking
distance. If you want to get around the city, there are trams and buses.
