This site was built through the shared efforts of many people. Happy people.
People with hopes, dreams, beer, and tasty veggie burgers.

In the spirit of humans.txt, we want to give you a glimpse of the people are who
helped make this website a reality.

Alex Waite with his slate-blue eyes;
Ben Poldrack with his calm brown eyes that are ever quick with laughter;
Laura Waite with her shamrock-green eyes, mischievous with play -- eager to roll and tumble;
and Adina Wagner with her vibrant, blue eyes -- the envy of any summer sky.

The content came from a wide range of people --- who also have eyes (mysterious
though their descriptions may be). They (the people that is, not their eyes)
were crucial to providing the site with quality content in such a short time
span.

Huge props to both Laura and Adina for the hours spent making the Hovering Brain
Hero a reality --- and for not hating me when our awesome Stevie Wonder
Watermelon-Wearing-an-EEG-Cap Hero no longer fit in with the site's theme. :-)
Believe me though, Stevie-Hero was /epic/.

And special thanks to you, for simply taking the time to check out
who we are --- the people who made this site happen.

It's nice to be humanized.

You stay classy.
