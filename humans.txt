This site was built through the shared efforts of many people. Happy people.
People with hopes, dreams, beer, and tasty veggie burgers.

The primary creators were:

* Alex Waite
* Adina Wagner
* Laura Waite
* Ben Poldrack
* Michael Hanke

The content came from a wide range of people, who were crucial to providing the
site with quality content in such a short time span.

Huge props to both Laura and Adina for the hours spent making the Hovering Brain
Hero a reality --- and for not hating me when our awesome Stevie Wonder
Watermelon-Wearing-an-EEG-Cap Hero no longer fit in with the site's theme. :-)
Believe me though, Stevie-Hero was /epic/.

And special thanks to you, for simply taking the time to check out
who we are --- the people who made this site happen.

It's nice to be humanized.

You stay classy.
