This site was primarily built by Alex Waite, Ben Poldrack, Laura Waite, and Adina Wagner
--- with content coming from a wide range of people too numerous to list,
but who were crucial to providing the site with quality content in such a short time span.

Huge props to both Laura and Adina
for the hours spent making the Hovering Brain Hero a reality
--- and for not hating me when our awesome
Stevie Wonder Watermelon-Wearing-an-EEG-Cap Hero
no longer fit in with the site's theme. :-)
Believe me though, Stevie-Hero was /epic/.

And special thanks to you for simply taking the time to check out
who we are --- the people who made this site happen.

It's nice to be humanized.

You stay classy.
